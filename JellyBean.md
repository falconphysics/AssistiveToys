# Make a JellyBean Button

At the time of this writing you can purchase a [12 pack of these buttons from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBT4QJFJ/) for $37. You just need a few tools and a mono cord. I like [these cords](https://www.mycablemart.com/store/cart.php?m=product_detail&p=5392) from MyCableMart. I save the jack end to use to adapt toys.
